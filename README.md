Case Study of a Design System for Web Development

## About
This is a final project for my Web Development class at Minneapolis College of Art and Design. The assignment was to replicate a website of our choice by using our own code from scratch. The website I referenced was the [sweetgreen homepage](https://www.sweetgreen.com/) and then I created a component library to build the final mockup site. Here are some quick links:
